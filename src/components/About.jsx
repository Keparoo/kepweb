              Iâ€™m a JavaScript, TypeScript, Node, React, Redux, Python, Flask,
              and SQL developer with graphic design skills who loves to capture
              the personality and zeitgeist of a client in the websites and
              printed materials that represent them. Over the past decade, I
              have created websites, restaurant menus, signage, brand
              identities, and social media campaigns for businesses on Cape Cod
              to establish for them more vital branding, greater community
              recognition, and increased customer volume.
