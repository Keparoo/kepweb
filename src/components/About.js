              Iâ€™m a Javascript, Node, React, Redux, Python, Flask, and SQL
              developer with graphic design skills who loves to capture the
              personality and flair of a client in the websites and printed
              materials that represent them. Over the past decade, I have
              created websites, restaurant menus, signage, and social media
              campaigns for businesses on Cape Cod establishing for them
              stronger branding, greater community recognition, and increased
              customer volume.

              Client training and tech support are important to me. I excel at
              patiently working with clients until they can confidently use
              technology to further their business needs.

              My recent focus has been on backend development skills which now
              allow me to create a more dynamic web experience for clients.
